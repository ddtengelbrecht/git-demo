## Ipsum Below
If dev is still in a broken state (can't activate the DB), can you please send me the db cfg output along with the SQLOGCTL.LFH/GLFH files from one of the databases?  You can determine which SQL0000X directory to collect them from by running
'db2 list db directory on <path>'
where <path> is the path from the 'db2 list db directory" command.
